Groups:

- Size related to the power (number of members \* their participation)
- Proximity to the center related to their votes similarity with the majority

Deputees:

- Position related to their proximity to the majority (the closer to the center, the more similar to the majority)
- Size related to participation => power in decision making
- Color related to their votes (the lighter, the more opposed to their group)

TODO

- Update A propos des statistiques in Group Drawer
- Compare all groups (members, majority proximity, inclusiveness...)
  https://recharts.org/en-US/examples/SimpleRadarChart
- Also CustomActiveShapePieChart for overall stats (power percentage)
- use scoreCohesion to break the sphere more or less (fragment)
