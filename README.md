# Poligraph

## Overview

A visual 3D representation of the French political landscape in the AssemblÃ©e Nationale based on the
political party affiliation and interactions of the deputies.

It turns daily updated voting data into a 3D graph, highlighting the proximity, loyalty and participation of deputies and groups in a more intuitive way.

Buit as a data visualization tool, to emphasize how much (immersive) 3D graphics can help understand complex data and relationships, more intuitively and in a more engaging way.

## Notes

Groups:

- Size related to the power (number of members \* their participation)
- Proximity to the center related to their votes similarity with the majority

Deputees:

- Position related to their proximity to the majority (the closer to the center, the more similar to the majority)
- Size related to participation => power in decision making
- Color related to their votes (the lighter, the more opposed to their group)
